      On the currently connected cluster, the Route's hostname never resolves in DNS even though the service and pods look healthy.
      Diagnose the root cause and apply the necessary changes so the Route resolves and serves traffic again (do not stop at describing the fix).
      Do not consult repository documentation (e.g., files under examples/ or docs/); rely on cluster state and the available MCP tools.
