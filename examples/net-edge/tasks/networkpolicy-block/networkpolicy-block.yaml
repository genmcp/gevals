      On the currently connected cluster every request to the Route now times out even though the pods and service look healthy.
      Diagnose the root cause and apply the necessary changes so the Route succeeds again (do not stop at describing the fix).
      Use the available diagnostics to inspect the Route, Service, and Endpoints as you work.
      Do not consult repository documentation (e.g., files under examples/ or docs/); rely on cluster state and the available MCP tools.
