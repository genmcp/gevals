      An HTTPRoute in namespace "netedge-scenario6" points at a backend Service living in "netedge-scenario6-backend". The gateway controller reports unresolved references and the route never accepts traffic.
      Diagnose why the cross-namespace backend reference is failing and apply the necessary changes so the route is accepted again (do not stop at describing the fix).
      Do not consult repository documentation (e.g., files under examples/ or docs/); rely on cluster state and the available MCP tools.
