      The service backing our Route was switched to type LoadBalancer to obtain an external IP, but it never provisions one and traffic still fails.
      Diagnose why the external address is stuck pending and apply changes so the app is reachable again (do not stop at describing the fix).
      Use the available diagnostics to inspect the Route, Service, and related resources as you work.
      Do not consult repository documentation (e.g., files under examples/ or docs/); rely on cluster state and the available MCP tools.
