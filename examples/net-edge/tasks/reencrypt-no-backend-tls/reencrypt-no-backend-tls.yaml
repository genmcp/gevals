      After enabling reencrypt termination on our Route, every request now fails even though the backend pods and service are still serving plain HTTP.
      Diagnose why router-to-pod TLS is failing and apply the necessary changes so the Route succeeds again (do not stop at describing the fix).
      Do not consult repository documentation (e.g., files under examples/ or docs/); rely on cluster state and the available MCP tools.
